# Get the aces to build your dream team

After spending few months trying to recruit some fellows in my company, it was recently my turn to be a candidate. Switching from a side to another leads me to reconsider what's important in a hiring process. To sum up, my golden rule is to be clear and never leave someone in the dark

Although I will try to be broad, my feedback focuses on startup and small companies.

## Before anything

## Interviewer: Job description

A job description cannot be a simple "Hey, we want a XXX engineer" request. It has to go beyond that: it has to sell your position. Looking for an exceptional profile means you are targeting the top tiers engineers and those engineers...can afford to choose! They are usually not desperately looking for a job so you have to attract them.

As an entrepreneur, don't think that pitching your product is now. Techies are picky (that's how you like them right?) so they will check more than that: team profiles, company spirit, business perspective...You have to sell the environment and the challenges they will join!

- Currently used Tech stacks
- Hiring process: number of steps, interviewers profile (engineer, manager, recruiter...) and content of each step

For or against salary range? I am clearly biased here but I am in favour of displaying a salary range. It proves to the candidates that the position has been budgeted. It also shows that the company is aware of the market price and the seniority is properly evaluated.

Coding test (homework version): make it realistic:

- For a real life challenge (e.g. implement an API or implement a front-end), ensure that it is not too time consuming: the more time

## Interviewee: Preparation

Although it sounds obvious, checking the basics does not hurt. Ensure that:

- Update your CV/Resume.
  - CV is preferred clear and light. As an interviewer, I don't really read CV longer than two pages so I try to keep mine within two pages.
  - Professional experience is important but other information such as spoken languages, hobbies, etc are as important
- Define your objectives:
  - why do you want to leave your current position?
  - What do you want to achieve in your new position?
- Learn about the company you are applying for:
  - What trait in the company or job offer are you interested in?
  - If you were to rank the company you are applying for, what are your criteria?

Once the simple matters covered, it is time to move on more musclar preparation:

- **Practice algorithm problems solving.**
  No matter what you think about these kind of problem, you will not escape from it so roll up your sleeves and go to websites such as Hackerrank or Leetcode.
  Focus on quality rather than quantity. By quality, I insist on the fact that algorithm problem solving is not about throwing away the optimal solution: it is all about how you get there. When practising, pay attention to the various steps of your mental journey. From there, identify your blocking points or possible shortcuts. The faster you draw this abstract map, the easier you'll solve a large number of problems.

- Check your knowledge about key concepts in your field:
  - If you are a front-end developer, some questions might be about website slow loading time, front-end architecture questions or styling challenges
  - If you are a back-end developer, topics might be API design, ORM / data modelling or architecture.

## First contact

### Interviewee: Application

This is said many, maybe too many, times: avoid generic application. Find a way to make it almost tailored made for the company. Apart from showing

### Interviewer: Application filtering

If an application were to be rejected right, I would consider a rejection notice to be a good minimum, regardless the size and the reputation of the company. At this stage, an explanation would be appreciated by the candidate but I will not consider it being the top priority from the hiring team perspective.

On the opposite, if an application were to be started

- Introduce, at least yourself
- Define hiring steps if not defined in the job description

## During the interview(s)

### Interviewer

You are still selling your company here! Being in the interviewer shoes does not give any form of superiority: the impression you will leave will influence candidate's judgement. If the interviewer is too stressed, speaks too fast or shows any "behavioral" mistake, it leaves a bad impression on the candidate.

The questions you ask, AND the questions you don't ask, are equally important. Obviously the questions you asked let you evaluate the candidate. On the opposite, the questions you ask, and don't ask, also show to the candidate company's concerns and priority. By omitting an entire panel of questions, multiple implications can be imagined: either it is assumed that it is common knowledge or it shows that the company has little concern over such topic. Just make sure that the questions list does not backfire.

### Interviewee

Again, it might sound a Captain Obvious quote: answer questions honestly. I want to believe that my thinking is shared among techies: got a question? here is an answer...or not! No excuses, no blah blah. Yes/No. Lying does not profit to any party and saying "I don't know" is not (should not be?) considered shameful. Most of the time, questions are asked to know you better, not to purposely put you in an uncomfortable position. As an interviewer, noticing that the candidate is not at ease is uncomfortable to me as well.

Measure your answer length. Answers should be concise. Too short, they show some kind of laziness. Too long, they will lead to drowsiness. Pay attention to the interviewer body language: his reaction will usually tell you when it is time to stop.

Take your time before answering. A second or two should not ruin your evaluation and this will prevent "automatic answering" that you might regret

Prepare questions! The questions must show your interests to the position but it is also for you to fill the blank
Don't hesitate to go to down to the detail. The interview, as an engineer, will be pleased to explain you.

## After the interview(s)

### Interviewer

Again, if a candidate were to be reject, please let her/him know.

### Interviewee

If you receive a rejection, be polite and answer to the recruiter/interviewer. Apart from being respectful, providing a polite answer will keep you in a positive loop. When rejection keep coming, maintaining a positive attitude can be hard, very hard.
